This project has been moved over to www.github.com/jpercent/auto-builder.

Auto Builder is an Ant build script generator for OSGi projects.  It complements the Eclipse Equinox Plugin Development Environment (PDE), such that all development can be done in PDE, and the PDE artifacts are resused for the automation environment.
